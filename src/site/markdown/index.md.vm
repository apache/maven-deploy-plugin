# ${project.name}

The deploy plugin is primarily used during the deploy phase, to add your artifact\(s\) to a remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects\. This is usually done in an integration or release environment\. It can also be used to deploy a particular artifact \(e\.g\. a third party jar like Sun&apos;s non redistributable reference implementations\)\.

As a repository contains more than JAR files \(POMs, the metadata, MD5 and SHA1 hash files\.\.\.\), deploying means not only uploading a single file, but making sure all associated artifacts are correctly updated as well\. This is the reponsibility of the deploy plugin\.

To work, the deployment will require:

- information about the repository: its location, the transport method used to access it \(FTP, SCP, SFTP\.\.\.\) and the optional user specific required account information
- information about the artifact\(s\): the group, artifact, version, packaging, classifier\.\.\.
- a deployer: a method to actually perform the deployment\. This can be implemented as a wagon transport \(making it cross\-platform\), or use a system specific method\.

The information will be taken from the implied \(or specified\) pom and from the command line\. The settings\.xml file may also be parsed to retrieve user credentials\.

Goals Overview
-------

The deploy plugin has 2 goals:

- [deploy:deploy](./deploy-mojo.html) is used to automatically install the artifact, its pom, and the attached artifacts produced by a particular project\. Most if not all of the information related to the deployment is stored in the project&apos;s pom\.
- [deploy:deploy\-file](./deploy-file-mojo.html) is used to install a single artifact along with its pom\. In that case, the artifact information can be taken from an optionally specified pomFile, but can be completed/overridden using the command line\.

Usage
-------

General instructions on how to use the Deploy Plugin can be found on the [usage page](./usage.html)\. Some more specific use cases are described in the examples given below\.

If you have questions about the plugin&apos;s usage, please read the [FAQ](./faq.html) and feel free to contact the [user mailing list](./mailing-lists.html)\. Posts to the mailing list are archived and could already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread\. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching the [mail archive](./mailing-lists.html)\.

If you think the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can file a feature request or bug report in our [issue tracker](./issue-management.html)\. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your concern\. Especially for fixing bugs, it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem\. For this reason, entire debug logs, POMs, or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated\. Of course, patches are welcome, too\. Contributors can check out the project from our [source repository](./scm.html) and will find supplementary information in the [guide to helping with Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html)\.
